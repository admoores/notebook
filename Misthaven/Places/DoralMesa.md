# Doral Mesa
  Doral Mesa is a massive plateau, a raised bluff of earth atop which a settlement has been placed. Originally upset from the south-eastern grasslands in the Shatter, its steep walls made for an easily defensible location. It is now a thriving township of around 10,000. While there is a road coiled about 2/3 of the way around the body of the Mesa, the denizens make use of an extensive network of cable lifts as well, from personal to sized for large cargo coming in from the river.

  The river in question is pretty narrow and deep, running through one of the larger cracks that formed as a part of the lifting of the Mesa itself. While cargo does run it, it's not traveled as much as some of the larger feeding rivers that flow south. Instead, the depth and relatively slow current make it perfect for a massive waterwheel that powers much of the town's infrastructure in one way or another.

  The people of Doral Mesa have a "silver lining" outlook as a result of their founding. The Shatter was horriffic, but their town is practically _designed_ for safe and happy living in a dangerous world.

### Cable Lifts
  The cable lifts make use of a massive system of flywheels and gearboxes that attach and detach as needed. For smaller lifts, a system comprised of a massive spinning axle around which expert porters wrap and detach ropes using complicated lasso-like maneuvers.

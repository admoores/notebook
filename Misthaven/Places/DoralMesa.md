# Doral Mesa
  Doral Mesa is a massive plateau, a raised bluff of earth atop which a settlement has been placed. Originally upset from the south-eastern grasslands in the Shatter, its steep walls made for an easily defensible location. It is now a thriving township of around 10,000. While there is a road coiled about 2/3 of the way around the body of the Mesa, the denizens make use of an extensive network of cable lifts as well, from personal to sized for large cargo coming in from the river.

  The cable lifts make use of a massive system of flywheels and gearboxes that attach and detach as needed

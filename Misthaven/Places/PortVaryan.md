# Port Varyan

    Port Varyan is a coastal town between Lake Sinrest and the ocean. It's caracterized by an ecclectic mix of terrains, from treacherous rocky cliffs to frothing beaches, to thin straits between the two bodies of water. Pre-shatter it boasted much the trade coming in from off-continent, utilizing a network of dozens of artificial canals and locks to bring vessels into the lake.

    The shatter left most of the canals destroyed completely, others became seasonal whitewater deathtraps. Those too proud or too stubborn to leave their home grew into a community of unflappable sailors, which eventually birthed the Port Varyan Maritime Academy:

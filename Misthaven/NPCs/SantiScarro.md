## Santiago Scarro

Santiago 'Santi' Scarro is a combat instructor in the city of [Doral Mesa](../Places/DoralMesa.md). His dojo trains many kinds of armed combat but Santi specializes in using short harpoons and a buckler (like the Aeil). The dojo mostly to younger Doral Mesa natives but his fame makes people travel to see him. These people pay and are usually subordinate to local students within the dojo.

Appearance: Santi has olive/caramel skin, black wavy hair, and a split goatee. He's muscular, about 6'2" 220lb, and has faintly enlarged lower canines (orc tusks). 

#### The Fighting Style (name TBD)
  Learning and passing down this style has been a huge part of the clan from which the Scarro family originated. "Scarro" is actually a derivation of that clan's name, the So'Karo I'etan (SOH-car-oh ee-eh-TAHN). It loosely means "shore-bound" (or something? TBD).

  The actual forms and fighting style revolve around carrying multiple harpoons in you offhand, which also has a buckler. You use the spears in close range or throw them, and you keep a coil of rope to attach to a harpoon before throwing _if_ ready for that. Common practices involve slowing/injuring a target first, before attempting to bind it. Historically they used it to hunt coastal creatures, in particular giant crustaceans. The stances and movement mimic those of a Duelist Crab, keeping a "claw" close and broadside for protection, with the other ahead to deal damage.

# Leopold Rainwhisper
    Born Leopold Kraven, later taking the name of his husband Adnan (for perhaps understandable reasons), he is a middle-aged Drow wizard who lives just south of the Kenkoran border in the rainforest. He has dedicated his life/research to understanding the Flux, both in how it affects the denizens of Misthaven but its theoretical underpinnings in the base laws of the Weave itself.

## Selenia Morrow
> She/her
```
Selenia has a fine coat of blue/purple fur, with scattered spots (further from her front) of darker blue. Her fur pushes out into a frill that frames her face, about 1" at its zenith, along with pointed, almost canine ears that mostly stay pressed to the sides of her head. She ports two spindly antelope-like antlers that follow the crest of her head somewhat closely before swooping up another 4" or so behind the actual back of her skull.

She speaks like Amy Pond.

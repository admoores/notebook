# Dr Augustus Reginald Bendarian Galio Smithsfield Dan Hauxen, Jr.
    A little-known academic within the Port Varyan Maritime Academy, an institution famous for producing many of Misthaven's finest sailors. Most graduate right into first-mate positions in trading fleets, or return to their home to serve as naval officers.

    A four-and-a-half-foot-tall bugbear with the hair and beard patterning of Hank McCoy, the fur coloration of an orange tabby, and the body proportions of a Forager. He speaks in an exaggerated victorian aristocratic affect.

    "Bully! New chums! .... (facetiously suspicious) Or is it new foes? Hup! Hup! On your toes man! You won't find Doctor Auggie a simple quarry!" as he waves around the closest implement he could pick up. A ruler or scribe of some sort.

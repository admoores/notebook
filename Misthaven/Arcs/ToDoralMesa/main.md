---
- Thokk takes notes of creature for research, sketches it with the macaques by its side.
    - The creature is called a Thruzig. For stats it's a Fomorian
    - A boar-snouted, gorilla bodied humanoid creature that often travels with a small group of small monkey-like creatures. 
- Opener: Mordan's 14 Perception Check on 2nd watch. Few hours' out of the mesa
    - The creature returns, this time carrying a staff with something of a mask attached to the top, and some odds and ends tied to it. The large creature uses the mask and the noises in an attempt to scare away whatever scared its macaques before.

#### Wavebreak Dojo
- Mercenaries come for Santi at some point 
    - Blade + Bounty Co.
        - Largely known to only take 'honorable' jobs, and they do not take kindly to deserters/defectors. Some speculate, however, that they have an understanding with some of those to take on "shadow jobs" that run directly through the same leadership.
        - *Idea* B+B Co. is a version of what something like the bannermen could become.
    - One of them [Dustin Cremley] is under cover as a student. Exceptional liar but hard to hide existing combat training (although that's not unheard of for Santi's students).

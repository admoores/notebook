---
- Thokk takes notes of creature for research, sketches it with the macaques by its side.
    - The creature is called a Thruzig. For stats it's a Fomorian
    - A boar-snouted, gorilla bodied humanoid creature that often travels with a small group of small monkey-like creatures. 
- Opener: Mordan's 14 Perception Check on 2nd watch. Few hours' out of the mesa
    - The creature returns, this time carrying a staff with something of a mask attached to the top, and some odds and ends tied to it. The large creature uses the mask and the noises in an attempt to scare away whatever scared its macaques before.

#### Wavebreak Dojo
- Mercenaries come for Santi at some point 
    - Blade + Bounty Co.
        - Largely known to only take 'honorable' jobs, and they do not take kindly to deserters/defectors. Some speculate, however, that they have an understanding with some of those to take on "shadow jobs" that run directly through the same leadership.
        - *Idea* B+B Co. is a version of what something like the bannermen could become.
    - One of them [Dustin Cremley] is under cover as a student. Half-elven, hard warrior. Exceptional liar but hard to hide existing combat training (although that's not unheard of for Santi's students).

## Nov 5 Session
### Mordan's Investigation in the Hall of Records [27]
 - So'Karo I'etan - Coastal nomads originally. The Scarro family had already branched off way pre-shatter, to the point that these historical references now are talking about things the Scarros pass about their history.
   - Lots endured into the family tradition, however. The fighting style, of course, but also many of the traditions that were historically linked to that fighting style.
     - Worship Paths: Worship is a strong thread. In the clan traditionally, children would show a general piety until in their late teens they join the path of one particular god whose domain suits them.
     - *Note, Implied* In the days of the OG clan this was much more diverse, for centuries it became more of a "pick one from a few and usually whatever one of your parents'". Even more recently it's more about general respect for the divine and their will in various things.
     - Burial Rites: A warrior is to be immortalized at their most valiant, thus buried with their armor/weapons/etc.
 - Do'rugo "Bellringer" Scarro was recognized as a Champion of Doral Mesa, a high honor bestowed by the city for those who stand as representations of all that Doral Mesa stands for
   - Part of DM's founding festival involves feats of strength, somewhat like KC. Back in the day the biggest portion of it was an actual combat tournament, a mix of competitor-vs-competitor and (_way_ back in the day) captured horrors.
   - Do'Rugo won the tournament 5 of the 8 years he was a competitor, and moved on to become one of its most well-known hosts/spokesfolk.
     - "Historian's note: The nickame "Uncle Bellringer" is often incorrectly attributed to this time as he was often responsible for initiating a bout between fighters, bell-ringing included. However, the epithet appears in news clippings and familiar correspondences prior to his involvement as a ring officiaint. It is most likely the name refers to his preference for much heavier, thicker bucklers than many other practitioners of Carcine combat techniques and the loud ringing they would make when struck particularly hard."
### Thokk's Sleuthing in the burial plot(s) [26]
 - The oldest headstone you see is about 220 or so years old, excepting many of the Scarro lifelines going back several more centuries.
   - "Those remains artifacts not recoverable from the original Scarro burial plot have been rendered in likeness and spirit, that we may remember our twice-lost ancestors"
   - Do'rugo Scarro passed 625 years ago. He is rendered in onyx upright on the wall, buckler-arm across his chest, sporting a beaten iron disc decorated with debossed waves, other arm at his side with a bundle of spears.
   - Several of the depictions have Ilmatari wheels/racks. It doesn't appear to be a deep-running and exclusive familial worship or you'd expect the whole mosoleum and its motifs representative of that, but it is definitely important to at least some portion of the family.
### Yos's man-about-town aventure [11]
```
The part of town that houses the Dojo is pretty quiet, all things considered. But then, it kinda shouldn't be. It's no less built up than the surrounding city, it just seems.... out of order? There's two or three more damaged oil lamps than normal for an area of a few blocks, there's a butcher's closed up with a sign citing mold, across from a tailor's with a broken and boarded window, catty-corner to a duplex with a crumbling balcony, the street-level area underneath roped off and marked with red strips of fabric. 
```
 - The Blade + Bounty Co. have systematically isolated the dojo. They'll never separate Santi's students from him, but they can at least prevent the nearby community from rallying for aid.
 - Most of the issues will show a hint of intentionality upon investigation [15/20/25]

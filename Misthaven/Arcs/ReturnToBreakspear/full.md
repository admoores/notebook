Thokk Nat 20 on praying for Lyra.

Mordan in the library - What next? Not _really_ expecting to find the answer but searches compulsively
  - Creature and its sealing
  - Bannerman trials, past precedent helpful, etc.
 ** Nat 20 Mordan and Yos
Thokk recommends personal writings of bannerman who lived a few centuries ago, ranger.
 Written as though journal, but was written much later. Initiate all through becoming a claw. Talks about sacrifices required.

Darien Zex - Botany prof, wood elf

Tonro - Troll wizard student
Tehom - beetleman dealer

In Eobor:
 - Thokk is a person of interest, Armand is seeking him and his companions
 - There are about 30 people in custody, most of them miners. Brandt is sending people with carapaces to collect the bounty and immediately post the bail for one person.
 - Mining has "ground to a halt". They could probably manage fine, but they're stretching every absence to put pressure on city hall to not resist the release wave.
  - Pass it 'round -
    - Stanos - Brass dragonborn bartender.
    - Tari - Elven sax-ish player. Recognized Yos, saw him playing here years ago and that's what made them become serious about music.
    - Willem - Dwarven owner of the establishment.

Thokk future:
  - Bannermen, scaled down, less leaving, but ready to assist OR
    Further decentralization: Breakspear breaks apart into regional


### NOTES SEP 3 AFTER TRIAL
- Maritime Historian track down outside of Breakspear.
- Shia'Jin - Monastery in the northern mountains.

Research Results: Double Nat 20

Combat Stuff / Maia's findings
- Lyra might not be a mastermind, but she obviously had training. Knowing her abilities, even accounting for some amount more than we know, she wasn't positioned to escape. It's easy to write that off as poor planning, but even subconsciously it doesn't make sense. She wasn't planning on leaving.
- Looking into the area, terrain, etc. came across writing on the palace/throneroom itself that they were in. Pre-shatter (some stuff they already know). Why wasn't it just part of the expansion to begin with? It could just be "oh it was out at the end, they may or may not have gotten there eventually" or it could be something about the area itself. There is a note that it was "especially tough carving" in one of the builder's notes on one of the expansions. "It didn't make sense to me that he went mad all the way back then, when the creature was supposedly still sealed. It had to be incomplete already".
---> What this means: There's a mineral in the rock itself that does 2 things: makes it hard to mine and conducts all kinds of energies. It's tungsten from his scales in veins. Bangrun Muldorahr found a tiny piece of it first, fashioned it into a tooth, which drove him mad.

Past Bannerman Trials
- There was a tribunal handled entirely among initiates for an offense on a training exercise. One said the other splashed acid on him in his sleep, the other said he was attacked and 'grabbed the first thing'" After returning to breakspear, with the implicit signoff from their superior, the "class" ran through the procedures on their own.
- Stories of very early bannerman "tribunals" before there was a true code, some are from before there was even a Breakspear. Some are after there was a rank structure. Basically, the Bannermen are older than their ranks which are older than Breakspear which is older than the existing Tribunal code. First mentions of it in its current form are within a few centuries of the shatter. Older forms, in the original language, speak only of "those most apt" which could just as easily mean people close to the case, third parties with relevant expertises, or a number of other things.
- Once there was a splinter tribunal. There was a Breath (Tranian Mays) on trial for bribery and the tribunal was obviously corrupt. There was a parallel tribunal (which wasn't specifically of rank-and-file bannermen, but didn't exclude them either) which conducted its own proceedings, unsanctioned at first. It took years for them to scratch the first official one, and they basically went on as if the other tribulan was the real one. Tiaus Korke, (others Kiriyan Vestra Claw, Adi Et'Zul Wing) was later promoted to the breath (bard), and the part where he wasn't at the time of the tribunal was heavily deemphasized (his promotion was part of the reason they were able to put it through). Yos only puts it together because of a song Korke wrote.

Mal'Zareth, its sealing, and so on

 - You are piecing together old folklore, legends, accounts, etc. of anything in the region, knowing that direct references were exhausted the moment you came back from the mountains. Every tome gives you a grain of sand more than nothing, and you're slowly building some idea of the times before and after the sealing. It's an old saying that makes it all click for you, a broken chain of translation. Most of what you see written by historians, even more ancient ones, refers to a "peaceful passing" or a "quiet passing", but you catch it in another context: Once it was said as an exclamation, as if in lieu of a gasp, "Death be silent" but it declines from an even older saying "May your death be silent" which leads to understanding the real translation of a curse "let the courier hear your death". What it talks about is preventing the creature from using your death to call out to its mistress.
  {Teres Muur; Teres a muur ne ahn, Se azh zareth teren}

 - ---> What this means: Mal'Zareth and Shar are not connected directly. MZ needs to kill, each death carrying a soul off to Shar with a whiff of his venom. Shar, who hears every being's last moment, would barely register an entire city being devoured. What would be even more powerful than that, though, is the _right_ soul, prepared before to die specifically for this purpose.
    The creature's soul aim is to catch his mistress' attention, even a glance, and to slay as many as needed to make that happen. He was once sentient, kind even. A majestic celestial drake, with brilliant tungsten scales and a jawline like a freight train. He was a reaper/ferryman, not to a specific death god. He witnessed a death which was part of a ritual sacrifice (performed by a Sharan death cult) to an eldritch horror from outside of time. Being so intwined with the death that brought the creature into this unfit reality, Mal'Zareth's mind broke and the only thing left in his psyche is some small bit that has thought to call out to Shar to end his pain.

- ----> The sealing was basically to prevent Shar from being able to pay him any attention, because it made him both more powerful and hungry for more. MZ cults tell it as if their mistress is deprived, and the way to fix it is to override the perception obfuscation. Even through prayer and planning, Shar's deific gaze glides right over the former reaper, but the death of a powerful Cleric to Shar, with MZ's name and story carved in runic script into her very skeleton, would strengthen him enough to fully shake off the binding. Otherwise he may physically escape but be weakened and forever (or, until someone else tries to help) unable to gain her eye.

### Daza At Breakspear

- tala - tiefling, terracotta skin

- Daza storms from the room "Absolutely typical. I'm wasting time none of us have, being here in this-"
 Tala: "Daza, wait. I'm sorry, I-"
 "What the hell was that in there? I _thought_ you'd have my back"
 Tala: "Hey, easy. You know I do, and you also know how these things work here. You're going to zap yourself south in a few days and who would have my back if I overstepped? I pinned these on _this year_."
 D: sighs "You're right, I'm sorry... They do look good on you"
 T: "Why thank you. Even shoddy craftsmanship can shine on my immacu-"
 D: "Okay, now you go easy"
 *The wings are a semi-vacant space in the memory. You can tell what they are, but also can't, as if the negative space is just telling you what isn't there*
 *laughs...*
 T: Anyway, I do have one more idea...

 #### Later
  *They are together in a basement hallway near an ash chute, having pulled bricks out of the walls to hide a device they were constructing*
 T: "Seriously, you might have better luck if you weren't so cagey. The Breath may be prickly, but they'd probably come around if they had a grounding theory to-"
 D: "We've been over this, I can't just lay it out. It's-"
 T: "Complicated, I know. You can't say how you know because to them it makes even less sense than what they already think and blah blah, maybe it's time to give up that tactic, D"
 D: "It's not a tactic, Tala, it's the best I can do. Trust me on this"
 T: "I do, it's just... hard to get the others to"
 D: "You're telling me... It's just-"
 *footsteps*
 T: "Shit, do your thing"
Daza magically molds stone around the object, along with a stand, some scrolls, and so forth, throws a perception slick spell on it, telekenetically reassembles the bricks, and Tala picks up an ashy bucket before they both walk off "So, he really did have a copy the whole time?" "Yes, right in with the first editions! Weeks, gone!" *both laugh*

The wings, and the rune, are both based on/made of tungsten, which has the special property of empowering the _intention_ of a magical effect (or being, in MZ's case). It can do anything from making the weilder resistant to counterspells, losing concentration, or in turn harder to resist their magic. It was working with it that made Daza first aware of the intermediate state and able to understand how she connected to it. The device shows a similar interference. Today, there's still an obfuscated pocket. There are a few spare parts, fragments of stone from another place in Breakspear, and some badly-decayed parchment. They all point to (with some difficulty to discover) a device capable of protecting a very large area, briefly and unpredictably, from a force that would otherwise rip all intentional magic asunder. Tala ultimately used this device to protect Breakspear, and her wings were a charm made by her friend Daza, which granted warcaster-like traits (as mentioned above)

### Suffering, Mal'Zareth, Lyra

Lyra: Her death was supposed to be a major piece of the plan. She has runes carved into her ribs, a ritual to conclude the moment she is killed. The original plan involved her death to give Mal'Zareth enough power to finish freeing itself. Done at the scene, her imbued corpse would have massively empowered Mal'Zareth. Done miles away, it is hard to say, but it could certainly set back the containment efforts if not worse.

She can't remember the details, but her mind knows the shape of a weakness in her plan. She's begun to scratch at her sides, plead with the guards, saying she can fix it but she doesn't know how over and over. Distracted, hard to get to talk.

 - She has a series of runes on her ribs that would have given the creature enough strength to survive the initial escape. In the battle that trapped it, it was also mortally wounded. It would actually be incredibly vulnerable otherwise (maybe, with the right plan).

 - Mal'Zareth is suffering. Whatever else might be true, that his freedom might please Shar, that this gesture might turn her eye to Lyra, what is _definitely_ true is that Mal'Zareth is suffering.

 - She could approach the creature before it is truly free, and if the ritual were correctly altered, could bring MZ low before the fighting even began in truth or before MZ could actually escape.

 - Lyra was always sharan, hid it for shame, but wasn't interested in betrayal or anything. She just worshipped a death god and hid it, claiming it was something else. The creature, its containment lessened due to a surge breaking part of the rune cage. Once it got into her mind, she was convinced it was her way to get closer to, gain favor/attention of/etc her god.

Characters

Vestash "The Tearful" Worvarax - Dragonborn tragedy bard/draconic sorcerer - Breath of Blackfyre
  - Gunmetal scales. Can be dramatic, but usually pretty normal
  - Supports most soldier-level folks but a lot of that is past loyalty

Travor Brightshield - Dwarven Paladin, Claw
  - short-ish (4") dark brown beard. Very by-the-book. Lands somewhere between the zealots and the military-ish group

Zaelith Dran’keth - Drow Gloomstalker Wing
  - Large scar across his throat, raspy voice. He's very much "The deconstructionists are right, but it's not worth the effort/won't work"

Manathar - Hasn't really thought about it, to him the non-soldier factions are just being weird.

Myrrha Drestyl - Elven Warlock, Breath

?? - Human Artificer - Carries a big wrench.
?? Willy? - Elven druid/artificer - Turned into a lizard to get inside the trike
  - Zealot
?? - Library curator, balding older human with round wireframe glasses
  - "Isn't taking sides"

Arcus Kent - Human Fighter
  - Golden retriever energy
  - Leans toward the Soldiers but has a shallow view of what that really means/looks like

Patience - Tiefling Wizard
  - Red skin, bulky upperr body.
  - Anxious
  - Horizontalist, but won't commit to it

---

Factions:
--
  Zealots - Starting to wear a shoulder drape (some of them). They are of the mind that Breakspear has gone astray because it has turned its back on Blackfyre. They want to push the order in a direction of reverance
    - The zealots are interested in a public execution. Some go so far as to call it a 'sacrifice' but many find that anywhere from tactless or dangerous.
    * They are hoping to use the spectacle to push extreme Blackfyre devotion into the norm, and push on passions to gain members as well as sympathizers. They're happy to have a "non-devout" member who nevertheless supports their allies' zeal.
--
  Soldiers - They believe a strict order, like a military, is the way forward. They kinda say it needs more discipline while also saying discipline has always been the strength. It's messy
    - The soldiers want to go by the book. Depending on the trial, this could be banishment or execution per declaration of guilt. There's a potential wedge on the subject of the memory spell.
    * Hoping that a strong display of by-the-book Bannermanning, followed by a continued emphasis on rules/protocol, will allow the ranked members to solidify hold. Predictability, reliability, etc. is the goal.
--
  Horizontalists - They think the order is outdated, designed specifically to reward age with detachment and power. They've taken to wearing less matching armor, but still with a prominent emblem. They think the way forward is to focus on what breakspear is for: training, resourcing, and a cohesive force to face down threats. They believe it should be more democratic, less based on seniority and more on situational mission-relevant authority, etc.
    - They are more interested in establishing the current threat she poses. They want a solution to the problem, less interested in blame or retribution than the other groups.
    * Pushing to adjust proceedings by introducing non-ranked Bannerman to the tribunal. Next steps would be to cement the precedent of "new blood" involvement, and continue to erode the rank structure.
      - Ganti Ashna - Middle-eastern-appearing halfling man, mustache, rogue assassin
        - The "internal thieves guild" is close to organizing behind him, but needs convincing.
          - Thieves guild, headed by Sylas Greenborough, a dark-skinned bald gnome rogue, is not a super strong collective but can act in unison from time to time. Sylas could be convinced to help if Thokk collects a rare ingredient for them on the creation of a toxin. The toxin is incredibly effective against extraplanar and undead creatures, but pollutes the battlefield horrifically when used. It's a sticky sap-like substance slathered onto blades. Windthistle could be found in the library's specimen storage as a sole study sample.
          "Listen I'm all on-board with what Ganti's got cooking, you don't gotta convince me on merit. I just need a better reason to take the risk you see, it's a big deal to move my crew publicly like this. You think you can make it worth it for us?"
      - Maia Elys - British - Half-elf woman, barbarian
        - Has enough goodwill witth Anya that a convincing word from Thokk about how she should be involved would likely push things forward. If she's already on deck for a role with testimony, it'll be a shorter leap to actually expand the tribunal.
      - Axis - Spock - Grey rock genasi elemental monk. Natural cracks cover his body, but he also has ritually-carved energy lines on his body. He treats his body like a scaled-down planet, complete with leylines, to manage his ki.
        - Of the three, is less convinced of the plan. He's very "if you all get this to work I'll show up" but if he could be convinced to actively advocate for space, it would improve their odds.

---

The site of the beast -->
  - Most of the original runes were intact, and the mages are having success patching the few that were disrupted. Thokk/others will have trouble remembering some of the details of the place, like a dream a short while after waking up.
  - Lyra has had it fully purged from her memory, and it has left her in a manic state. She's excited to be executed, to be with her lady Shar forever

---

Magistrates for the Tribunal
 - Travor Brightshield - vague british isles - Dwarven Paladin - Shortish beard, mostly unadorned. Whitish-silver armor with black enamel.
  - Leans Zealot, could be convinced to Horizontalist (Faith angle?)
 - Elias Veldrin - Italian (like Ash's mom) {aye-shoo no be surprise(light roll r)}- Breath, Warlock - A pale, gaunt man with short blond hair and cold blue eyes. His fingers are stained with ink from endless note-taking
  - Leans Soldier, could be persuaded to Zealot
 - Anya Renn - American - Rogue/swashbuckler - A lean, weather-beaten woman with auburn hair tied in a tight braid. Her arms are covered in faint scars from thorns and claws
  - Leans Horizontalist, could be persuaded to Soldier
---

Interviews
  <Day 2>
  Renn - Main interest: Fixing any cracks. "I don't like offing her in her current state, but an execution is expedient. What concerns me is how this went so smoothly for as long as it did."
    - How long was Lyra planning this? How long was she a cleric of Shar?
    - Who fell first, and how? Why Kinsit and Manathar
  Veldrin - Main interest: "Every failure is a chance to strengthen our numbers".
    - Slickwort - A shiny-barked vine, kinda like kudzu but dark brown. Can only grow new roots when its exterior is damaged.
    - Looking for closed execution, quick and unremarkable, followed by the founding of a permanent task force for internal investigation, loyalty enforcement, etc. Its first mission will be to find anyone still harboring loyalty to Shar, the creature, or the plan, voluntary or otherwise.
  <Day 3>
  Brightshield - Main Interest: blame, shame. He's going to push Thokk to "out" as many bannermen as possible, especially Manathar. If Thokk defends him, he will threaten Thokk as well.
    - It would be my preference to resolve this matter in one tribunal, but it is within my right to call another if it is my belief that a Bannerman has colluded with a favored instructor to aid him in escaping judgment.
    - Has been convinced of Veldrin's plan with the task force

    -- "It was weeks ago when Manathar's "devotion" started
     - "Something was different"

Political Tracker

 ***** NOTE +3 on next call it if at concert ******

- Insight, Persuasion, Intimidation, Deception, etc.
- DC set by whatever the thing is, but you add based on the unlocked rerolls (bonus stays even after reroll is expended).
- Failure by 5 or more, or any failure for certain things (intimidation for ex.): Instability goes up. Success by 5 or more: Instability goes down.
- "Call It" - Roll d10s for the number on the tracker. You are aiming for 50. If you do not get 50, for every d10 that is below the instability tracker, you lose 1 progress. Any 10s reduce instability
- Open Deliberation: During Open Deliberation, only rolls below half the instability rating (round down) are lost, and 9s also reduce instability.

** Note for later: If the tribunal goes ahead with the new members, the rogues will hold the credibility (and thus maybe the precedent) hostage for some extra concessions around secret activity etc (anti-surveillance kinda vibes?), given Thokk's partial pass on the test**

NOTES: Next Time -- Party in the warehouse sub-basement. Center of the room, leaving all the shelves in place. Stage at x.

-------------------

Since the tower and realizing what Yos can do, The rest of Thokk's mission is to get Yos and Mordan to the tower, or whatever it takes, to "fix it". If he dies or whatever else. He was happily in maintenance mode until Bilgewater, where meeting the other two showed him there's a "path" to take, which needs a protector, fighter, pragmatist.

Open Deliberation. opdib

Player Rumors:
 - They killed Lyra immediately to cover up that this shit goes all the way to the top. The tribunal is just to cover up, make it look resolved before plan B
 - Once the tribunal is over, they're just going to send bannermen after MZ until it's dead.
 - One of the higher-ups is banging Yos? Has a bannerman kid?

  - Opening: Root out corruption, a dedicated force not watching its own back
  - Stance: Closed Execution (Agenda: Soldier)
 - Renn
  - Opening: We have work to do. Nothing good will come of killing the frightened husk of a death-worshipping psychopath
  - Stance: Outsource holding ()
 - Veldrin
  - Opening: (cuts before Renn) Couldn't agree more with Brightshield, in fact that is why we need the group
  - Stance: Open Execution ("Pacted" with zealots, isn't a hard believer himself)
  **
 - Maia
  - *Op: "There's talk of restoring trust, but we do trust each other deep down. The solution isn't pretending we can become something immune to malice, but to act on that trust and speak to each other"
 - Axis
  - *Op: "It is not my intent to convince or sway, but to remind us what we already know to be true. We are those who choose our tools wisely and turn them to precise effect. I ask each of you to evaluate the tools used to seek justice in this trying time, and ask if it is time to put them down.
 - Ganti
  - *Op: "... You heard 'em"
  - Staying quiet, prepared for a walkout. Thokk might clock a signal to Silas and have a moment to intervene

   - Veldrin in particular trying to grill him
 - Griswald
 - Magda Renlow, a weathered dwarf woman with cropped iron hair and scars tracing her jaw.
 - Jorvan Kett, tall half-elf with stern hazel eyes and armor kept polished to a mirror shine.

Experts - 
 - Maia (if not tribunal)
 - Patience
  - The holding isn't entirely based on the physical location. A lot of the memory part would have followed it from the cage [[This is what Lyra was going to override with her death. A sacrifice Shar couldn't ignore, even with her eyes magically averted]].
 - Tamsin Vale, a human woman with pale skin, quick green eyes, and a belt heavy with vials.
  - Traces of magic that aren't accounted for in the prep or battle, rituals brought inside, etc.


****** Events
-- "The prisoner Lyra is in no state to testify as to-"
"No state? You mean living?" (Scottish)
 ** Half-cloaked member takes her name ** "Oh yeah write me up, scalebrain"
 - Brawl to prevent? (or steer?)

-- MZ/tungsten/amplified intention of modify memory, made it _perfect_ in excising the creature from her mind. Her runework is all targeting MZ's memory, likeness, etc.
  ** Thokk: Do you think they're worried we'll find out they can do this??
   --> They're worried about people knowing they can do this _unintentionally_

   - They want to clean up the mess of what they already did to Lyra, esp. the fact that it went way beyond their intent. Renn wants her off-site to reverse-engineer what happened so they _can_ replicate it.
-- 

Halric Dodd - Guard who let Thokk in for a few minutes the other night, is at the door. What people think Clark Kent looks like via glasses.


****** Past thing
Myrra following apparition out of the chamber. "The moon phases are predictable and universal anchor events, but it turns out more nebulous parallels can be utilized" (using major change in Bannermen).

If - 
  "We" lose: Ganti/Silas walkout
  Zealot attempted murder
  Crackdown (soldiers? Zealots?)

Lyra's Current State:
 - Bandaged and bound, she has wounds on her ribs. She doesn't know what she knew, only that she somehow thinks she can "fix it"

 Twenty-One
  - A game of blackjack
  - Each player puts an ante into the pot and DM matches
  - Each player has access to the following dice: d20, d12, d10, d8, d6, and d4
  -  You pick which dice to roll and your objective is to get as close as you can to totaling 21 without going over. Once you roll a die, place it off to the side and it contributes to your total—you cannot use that die again this round. Players take turns rolling TWO dice of their choice, then continue taking turns rolling ONE die of their choice until everyone holds or busts.
  -  Closest to 21 without going over wins the pot.

---

Schedule:
 - One day of closed deliberation. The magistrates will finalize their aims
 - Two days of interviews. Each magistrate will call each witness. Thokk is back-to-back (Renn then Veldrin) in the evening of the first day, right around evening mess. His third (Brightshield) is the second afternoon
 - One day of open deliberation in three sessions. Roundtable of all wing/breath/claw, with the rest in gallery.

 - Initiate, Genine, freckled human, brown hair with a blonde front streak and a blue eye on that side. Anxious, saddled with the Soldiers but (like most initiates) is more stuck with whatever their primary instructor has going on.;

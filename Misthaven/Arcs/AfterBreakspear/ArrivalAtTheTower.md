### Future Plans
- Longer term, want to be able to do anthology stuff.
- Also feel like I can do way better (but also not really locked in?)
- Do we want to lock into a particular trajectory (even if it's months) to try and drive the stor[y|ies] home, or do we want to get into a rhythm, keep adventuring, and meander towards more and more "monumental" quests as it becomes interesting?

### Session Notes
 - Dream dive to investigate Daza: What about their magic (Rielle/Daza) was taboo? Why did Rielle come to Daza for help on this?
 - Time leading up to the event? Preparation, mindset, etc.
 - Familial connections might be what actually brings it home, mainly the Floshem stuff. Maybe chasing this will do something more important, and the "revenge" is just a bonus.
 - Helmets: Item cards
 - Bike stat card

### Session Start 
- Mid-morning. Leopold's Tower, just arrived in the teleportation circle. Leopold and Adnan have prepared for the arrival, with a floating tea tray at the ready.

### Maritime Historian
  - [Dr. Augustus Dan Hauxen](../../NPCs/Misc/DrDanHauxen.md) - A largely-unknown academic in the [Port Varyan](../../Places/PortVaryan.md) Maritime Academy.

### Library Research
- [Leopold](../../NPCs/LeopoldRainwhisper.md) was contacted by [Danton Crulio](../../NPCs/Bastion/Library/DantonCrulio.md) about his ongoing research into the early mappings of the southern coast and, in particular, the ocean. It turns out there was a reference to something Reisha and Leopold had worked on a long time ago. It was supposed to help map the reefs below the surface
  - The project was abandoned because it apparently showed no results in the few forays into the deeper/more dangrous waters. 
  - With Leopold having dusted it off, he was waiting for "your man [Cantis](../../NPCs/Bastion/Cantis.md) to come retrieve the research materials. Perhaps we can get a headstart on some of these details now that you're here.
    ```
    I was surprised to hear from one of your researchers about an old project of mine and Reisha's. I'd been advised that a courier would be on his way to retrieve what I had left of the endeavor.
    ```
  - The research will reveal (Int checks, good questions) a very slight difference in the readings at the very edge, showing that the _actually nonexistant_ seafloor was slowly becoming more tangible.
  - Leopold estimates Cantis will arrive "tomorrow evening". Cantis is, in fact, quite fast and he'll arrive in the morning.
      - Cantis will arrive on the trike, with a new helmet and boasting some modifications on the bike itself. The helmets make any obscuring effect one level less, provide immunity to gaseous effects, and give blindsight within 10ft

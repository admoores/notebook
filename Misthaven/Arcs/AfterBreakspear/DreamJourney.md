### Dream Sequence Number 2

- In each sequence, at the end a piece of Daza splits off and walks away in to the dark dream expanse

Sequences: 
 1) Children, spark jumps
 1) Parents, overhear
 1) Wizard school (several?)
 1) In her home (pre-tower), centuries later
    - She attempts to actually use it, it unleashes absolute chaos. Her spell does what it was supposed to do many times over, but with the "intention" of the effect. In this uncontrolled state it basically monkeys-paws.
    - Mage Hand?
 1) Searching the southern grounds?
 1) In the tower, with Rielle, before the frantic times, just trying to accept the state of things and move forward alone
 1) The final moments, casting the 3 spells.
 1) After?

#### Daza's connection to the specific Sorcerous bloodline
 - Throughout her life she constantly held back in her Wizard training, specifically refusing to rely on something that would have made it all so much easier. 
 - As a young girl, overhears her parents talking. "Did you hear they think that Rielle girl might be spark-touched? I always knew her family was unclean"
 "Styriel stop!" "I'm just saying..-"

 - "You can sense the weave pulsing, just beyond the threads of the spell, begging to be woven a dozen dozen times into themselves, to become infinitely more intricate, and you feel yourself peel the power away as a weary bolt, more smoke than fire, trudges across the training room. Your professor eyes you. 'Better, Daza, but you still aren't quite there'"
  - 'I know you come from vinters, Kraven, but maybe you should stick to tea before class' classmate

#### How would Rielle have known?
 - There was a time when they were much younger, when a reaction happened between the two of them. Rielle knew what it was, Daza played it off like it was entirely Rielle. They never really talked about it, but Rielle didn't think Daza had gone so far as to deny it entirely.

#### Times leading up to the Shatter
 - This is after everyone has said no. She is frantic, trying to prepare something to channel the energy. Effectively she has to "cast" something so massive that it not only dissipates the extra energy but dulls all casting enough that nobody can accidentally pull too much.
 - A shaky automaton of silvery metal and mossy wood with a porcelain face named Rielle follows Daza's preparations

 - Cut ahead to the final moment, she throws a hasty mess of spells into the chamber
    - Time Stop, Prismatic Wall - on purpose
    - Psychic scream - Involuntary, through the 'other' means

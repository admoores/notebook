#### Fleetcaptains
 - Danielle Mantrose -  
    - Descendant: Sylvester Mantrose: A shaggy-haired sea-traveler. Known for his obsessive collection of maritime artifacts, treasures, and (to many) actual trash.
 - Edmond Scarro - 
    - Descendant: Santi Scarro - Lives in Doral Mesa in northeastern Kenkor. In posession of the original mastseal. Unknowingly, as it is currently thought to be an heirloom buckler. Santi is a weapons instructor, catering mostly to younger Doral Mesa natives but his fame makes people travel to see him. These people pay and are usually subordinate to local students within the dojo.
 - Baelgon Derritus - 
    - Descendants - **<*>** Edwyrd and Sylvester are chasing these two down
        - Magriol Derritus - Direwood
        - Stanto Derritus - Edgewater

#### The Mastseal
- The Alu-Nu's original mastseal would represent original ownership of the vessel to Danielle Mantrose. Ships change hands, mastseals are replaced, but integral to Avis' betrayal was pretending the ship was _always_ a Floshem family asset, and it backed most of the initial expansion.
    - Fleet formation rules are very strict about expansion, especially when it comes to your existing vessels. It's a "good reason" statute around vessel acquisition/building.
    - It comes from a shatter-era tradition, where it was considered incredibly wasteful not to keep absolutely every vessel as absolutely sea-worthy as possible. 
- **Currently** In the posession of Santi Scarro, as an heirloom buckler.

##### Other Notes
- Avis Floshem, Mordan's grandfather, betrayed the existing fleetcaptains to take over the enterprise entirely for his family.
- Tremerian, Avis' father, took ill rather suddenly and passed during all of this. From the outside it just looked like normal growth, restructuring, scaling, etc.
- In reality, Avis had to welch on and bury several deals with the original fleetcaptains.
- The Alu-Nu (new dawn, rising sun, etc.) was the first ship of the fleet. 

#### Sequestered Town Idea
- There is a group of people living somewhere in/around the southern shore, forcibly isolated into a pocket town. They will _worship_ Mordan if they learn his name, because the last boon their ancestors received, which allowed them to survive long enough to become sustainable, was a special delivery (by Danielle).

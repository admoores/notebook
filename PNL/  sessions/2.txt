Veronica: Pinch and stitch - Favor - Abbess Tinish (galapa) has a very fine wimple... Gave me a list/note with her signature to enter the Abbey to collect some weavesilk
 - Weavesilk - Made by weave spiders - One of the endemic PNL lifeforms, underground and in caves. They are "cowardly". They spin very intricate webs and cover tunnels in them such that they form impassible walls, where their food gets trapped.
  - called weavespiders because they were quickly/easily domesticated, they weave silk _and_ turn it into fabric.

The weave isn't really a well-known model for describing the world. I have heard it referenced, but it doesn't really make sense to me. 

Guardcaptain who came to summon me - Kaval

Miner's Rebellion - Two lords from the 100 lords reach, Joffrey Ytsimas, Midas Longquill, "lover lords", instigated. Amos Marwyn and Longquill dueled, both dying, rebellion ended. After the duel, it is said that the stone glowed white hot and melted through several of the stones it was set on, which had to be rebuilt. 

Vision? Memory? - 
 - I feel incredibly hot, burning painfully, hands grasped around metal bars that I shake and rattle
 - In a cage of hard vines and wood and earth, I shake and pull. Instead of fire, I feel smothered, unable to breathe

Marwyn - Aged, patchy hair Infernis. Looking especially old/frail as I see her now. Dressed in a similar style to Veronica. 
 - Assessment - She just appears to be having a harder time with her advanced age than average. 
 - She wants to be implanted into a clank body

"Soul" has to have a place to hold/contain until it is put into the casing (psy-reactive material).

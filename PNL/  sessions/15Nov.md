Marwyn's dirt 
 - Unsanctioned magic: me, Phillius
 - What about Ignacious Felfarrow?

Ignacious' ciphered notes
 - I have a few pages to try and break the cipher 

Veronica - Steal Abbess's Whimple


## Battle
2 people on horses
12 ooze creatures
3 shambling, slow creatures behind

## Post-battle
- Some of the wounds are old. [N4v3 shares]: they are mining injuries.

## Midas/Ambrose
- Draff uncovers letters between Midas Longquill and Ambrose.
- Ambrose: Maybe you shouldn't have tried to rebel against the Marwyns.
- Ambrose: "You have done much damage to this town, Midas. If you seek true repentaance, I will grant it to you, if only you agree to help me with a problem that the miners of this town are well aware of and that the church refuses to acknowledge"
- Midas: "You have brought the silver truth upon me... and I acquiesce to whatever demand you make of me"
- "mouth of hell beneath the town, take up charge, swear a knightly oath to protect the town. You will be well-fed."

## Ambrose
- "unconventional" "a little weird" "Listened to the villagers"
- More focused on real problems of real people, not the church's prescriptions of how things can be kept happy.

## Draff
- Pyra has always thought that piety, etc. was kinda silly. There are beings with different levels of power/influence on the world, and it's a continuous spectrum all the way up to and beyond The Progenitor, with smaller populations as you go up.
- After watching what happened with Draff, I'm left to wonder if that was fundamentally wrong, and that those who worhsip the Progenitor are actually aware/onboard with a categorically different kind of power, influence, purpose, destiny, etc. etc.
- When something goes against the Progenitor's will (plan?), something _will_ show up to set it back on course.
- Went from thinking the progenitor is a meddler to a tyrant

## Werewolves
- People who were brought over at the start, there had to be lycanthropes (vampires, etc.) among them. There might be some familial passage?
- Lycanthropy is different from vampirism. Lycans aren't inherently evil/violent/hungry for 
- Forestkeeper's grove: long and storied history of them having were-creatures.
- Intentionally, with intent to pass the curse. 
- No knowledge of doing so with spells, potions, etc. but it could be theoretically possible. If that was done, it would likely not be the _same_ as a full lycan, vamp, etc.

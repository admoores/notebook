### Points
 - In general, when you're pre-paying: you're basically saying you're not going to have a chance to refinance in the next 4 years or so. About 4 years is the time it takes to recoup
 - As I work through the disclosures, keep an email with questions to Tyler, then we'll talk on the phone and I'll have all the answers I need.
 - Choose insurance by middle of next week.
   - Wait until inspections.

Questions:

 - Signed everything twice?

Clerical: 
 - That's no _my_ work number, it's my company's corporate number.

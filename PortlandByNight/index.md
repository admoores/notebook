# Portland By Night

```
An elysium-heavy factional discord story about trying to negotiate with almost-at-odds kinda-allies to prevent malicious takeover. It starts with deals and resource pipelines drying up, then contacts going silent, and eventually kindred going missing. I'm no conspiracy theorist, but each instance could have been hand-chosen to make the smooth operation of Portland as an anarch domain much more difficult.

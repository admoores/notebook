### Oct 28 Session

#### Opening Concept
```
We begin a little more than 3 months from departure from Earth's orbit. Events have been planned throughout the ship, timed to celebrate the crossing of Mars' orbit radius. 

Our players each receive an "invitation" to the fanciest one. We'll view them each receiving the invite a week in advance before cutting to the night of, after any prep they want to do. Atrium within the Prime decks. A massive arboratum with courtyards and such sprinkled throughout, and a view out into deep space, repeating every 2 and a half minutes or so.

Mr. Dowd,

It is my greatest pleasure to extend to you, our quarterly Exceptional Accounting Award Recipient, an invitation to the Palazzo Merced in one week's time, where we will celebrate the crossing of the Martian Boundary.

### Oct 28 Session

#### Opening Concept
```
We begin a little more than 3 months from departure from Earth's orbit. Events have been planned throughout the ship, timed to celebrate the crossing of Mars' orbit radius. We zoom into the Atrium within the Prime decks. A massive arboratum with courtyards and such sprinkled throughout, and a view out into deep space, repeating every 2 and a half minutes or so.

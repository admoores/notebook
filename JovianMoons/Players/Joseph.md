Ministry pharmacist, on the ship to convert cultists both in transit and at the destination. Used presence to make real the idea that the pharmacy exists, even though it was not one of the manifested storefronts.
 - Sire set you up, sequestered midship, trying a number of masks before finally settling on the pharmacist role.
 - Spending the time getting people hooked, creating network/cult, etc.
 - Has people endebdted to him. 2 dots influence by going to the upper decks and personally attending to rich folks. Socialites, wealthier, etc. Looking for stepping stones.
 - Pharmacy is in a middle-deck place, not cheapest or nicest
 - Members of herd both move the illicit drugs, as well as the highest-level members of the cult (15 people).
 - Spent at least a century in torpor
 - Positioning to be the "baron" of the coronet. Only so far as needing to have a handle on the existing Kindred structures/society, such as it may be, to know what he's working with.

 - contact Devin McColough, Real Estate - Boston-y (plus Bunnie?) accent

 - Considers Elwood to be his long-running project

 - Semira - Female pharmacist (ghoul?)

 - Touchstone - Genetic descendant - In the same type of research grant place as Eoghan. Zero direct contact, they don't even know Leo exists.

- Average build, average height, bald, groomed longer beard. Serpentine, yellow eyes.

#### For Me

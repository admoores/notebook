# Jovian Moons

- Advanced Dynamical Systems: They need to continually capture true kindred, otherwise their Distilled bloodline will thin too much and become useless. They made sure there would be some onboard.

- The apparent plot is securing a place for Kindred in the new society. 
- Unknown to start: They will discover discipline-based technology throughout the ship that will be used to capture and drain the "fresh" kindred.

- Several hundred years today and over a century since the masquerade was irrevocably shattered, humanity seeks new homes away from Earth. A global corpocracy (sic) sprang up in the wake of the (near) extermination, the greatest of which being Bulwark (subject to change) which is a miltech firm that was at the forefront of the war on the night.
- *POSSIBLE* Secretly, Bulwark has kept kindred after finding a way to blood bond them to mortal(ish) Bulwark commanders (given the right cocktail and torturous circumstances). Some kindred exist in shadows, and precious few escape servitude directly.
- A vessel departed for Europa, with Bulwark intending to unleash some calamity on Earth to finally be rid of all but their "distilled" bloodline, which is what they rely on both for direct indenturing but also many of their special sauces.
  - Caitiff, but with some extra mechanic? Harder to get hungry, harder to slake?

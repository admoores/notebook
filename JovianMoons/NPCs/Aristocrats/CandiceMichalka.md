### Candice Michalka

- A slender 50-something woman, about 6' tall, sporting a forest green sequined floor-length gown. She's a little oblivious and doesn't seem to know it. She speaks in a stereotypical "posh" way. Think "ghastly" said g-aaaahhhh-stly. Dark, mostly straight hair sprayed down to her head in a manner you think might protect her from concussion.
- "You know, Gaia, isn't it a bit ironic that that's your name? Seeing as how we've left the Earth behind?"
  - My father did have a sense of humor
  - : OR :
  - Oh my, Candice, you're so right. Goodness I can't believe this is the first I'm considering this!

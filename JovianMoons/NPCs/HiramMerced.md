### Hiram Merced

- Alive since before the extermination and assuming various identities throughout the years, he has remained the CEO of ADS. Officially, he is staying on Earth and intends for Gaia to be his counterpart in the Jovian Moon system.
- Is he on the ship? 


- Hiram is the ship, sortof. Gaia, as a last betrayal and payback for his tyranny, fleshcrafted him into the ship and left behind a stooge Distilled, also fleshcrafted to look like Hiram, as head of ADS.
  - The equivalent of a 9th-gen after centuries of pure diablerie, but so spread out it doesn't register
